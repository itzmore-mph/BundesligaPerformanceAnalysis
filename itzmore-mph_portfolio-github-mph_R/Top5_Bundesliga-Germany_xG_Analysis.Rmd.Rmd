Comprehensive Analysis of Expected Goals (xG) in Bundesliga Performance
Introduction
This project undertakes a detailed analysis of Bayer 04 Leverkusen and other top Bundesliga clubs during the 2023-2024 season, focusing on the Expected Goals (xG) metric. Using R Studio, I apply sophisticated data manipulation and visualization techniques to explore how effectively teams and players convert their chances into goals. This analysis aims to uncover deeper insights into team strategies and player efficiency, providing valuable insights for club management and sports analysts.

Data Preparation
The analysis begins with the preparation of several datasets sourced from official Bundesliga statistics, reputable sports data APIs, and Kaggle. These datasets include detailed match events, player statistics, and club performance metrics. Initial data processing involved cleaning, transforming, and standardizing data formats to ensure accuracy and reliability for the analysis.

# Data loading and initial cleaning
games <- read_csv("path/to/games.csv")
game_events <- read_csv("path/to/game_events.csv")
players <- read_csv("path/to/players.csv")

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the EDA phase, I used summary statistics and correlation analysis to understand the relationship between xG and actual goals scored. This provided initial insights into how well teams and players are performing against the expectations set by their shot quality and match situations.

# Summary statistics and correlation heatmap
print(summary(games))
ggplot(data = game_events, aes(x = xG, y = goals)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Correlation between xG and Actual Goals")

Performance Analysis
A detailed performance analysis was conducted to compare expected and actual outcomes for matches and the entire season. This included comparing xG to actual goals for each match and aggregating this data for a season-long overview.

# Analyzing performance based on xG
team_performance <- aggregate(xG ~ team, data = game_events, sum)
colnames(team_performance) <- c("Team", "Total_xG")


Market Value Analysis
Using xG and player performance data, I explored the impact of player efficiency on their market value. This involved visualizations that depict the relationship between a player's expected performance (xG) and their actual market valuation changes over the season.

# Market value trends visualization
ggplot(data = players, aes(x = xG, y = market_value)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Market Value Trends Based on xG")

SQL and R Integration
I utilized SQL queries to efficiently pull specific subsets of data for deeper analysis and then used R for advanced statistical modeling and visualization.

# Example SQL query executed in R
dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT player_id, SUM(xG) as Total_xG FROM game_events GROUP BY player_id")

Predictive Modeling
The predictive modeling phase focused on using linear regression to predict future performance based on historical xG data. This model helps in understanding potential future trends in player and team performance.

# Linear regression model for predicting goals from xG
model <- lm(goals ~ xG, data = game_events)
summary(model)

Conclusion
This comprehensive analysis revealed key insights into the effectiveness of teams and players in the Bundesliga, particularly how well they convert scoring opportunities into goals. The findings suggest that while some teams perform well above their xG expectations, others may need to review their tactical approaches or player selection to improve efficiency.

Future enhancements to this project will include a more granular analysis of shot types and player positions to better understand the dynamics affecting xG and actual scoring performance. Moreover, integrating additional data sources like player fitness and in-match events could provide a more detailed predictive model for future performance.

This project demonstrates my ability to utilize advanced analytical techniques in R to derive actionable insights from complex sports data, making it an excellent showcase of my skills in sports analytics for potential employers or collaborators in the field.
